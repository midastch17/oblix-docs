# Integration Guides

This section provides practical guidance for integrating Oblix into various application architectures and deployment scenarios.

## Overview

While Oblix can be used directly as a Python SDK in your applications, there are several common integration patterns that can help you build more robust and scalable AI-powered applications:

1. **FastAPI Server** - Create a backend API that uses Oblix for model orchestration, providing a simple HTTP interface for your frontend applications.

2. **Frontend Integration** - Connect your web or desktop frontend applications to an Oblix-powered backend.

3. **Troubleshooting** - Solutions to common integration challenges and runtime issues.

## Why Use Integration Patterns?

Integrating Oblix through these established patterns offers several advantages:

- **Separation of concerns** - Keep your AI logic separate from your application frontend
- **Resource management** - Handle model loading and unloading more efficiently
- **Error handling** - More robust handling of API errors, timeouts, and connectivity issues
- **Scalability** - Easier path to scaling your AI features as your application grows
- **Security** - Better protection for your API keys and credentials

Choose the integration guide that best matches your application architecture and use case.
